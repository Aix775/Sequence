## Philosophy

The key philosophy for Sequence.js is to aid you in creating your animated step-based application without getting in the way of how you or a web browser work. Create content and then animate it using the HTML and CSS you're used to. There's no special syntax to learn, no limitations on the elements you can use, and no heavy JavaScript implementations recreating what the browser is already capable of.
