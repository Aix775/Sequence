=====================

## The CSS Animation Framework

*Pre-alpha warning: Sequence.js v2 is not yet ready for production and is only made available for testing and development. Many features are yet to be implemented and those that have are yet to be tested. If you're looking for a production ready version, checkout [Sequence v1](http://sequencejs.com/).*

Sequence - An animation framework for creating sliders, presentations, banners, accordions, and other step-based applications.

## Philosophy

The key philosophy for Sequence is to aid you in creating your animated application without getting in the way of how you or a web browser work. Create content and then animate it using the HTML and CSS you're used to. There's no special syntax to learn, no limitations on the elements you can use, and no heavy JavaScript implementations recreating what the browser is already capable of.

## Demo Themes

- Basic - A basic slider that moves side to side
- Modern Slide In - A minimalist theme for showcasing products
- Pop Slide - A colourful slider with highlighted pagination
- Cube X - A basic 3D cube that spins on the X axis
- Test Theme - Used for Testing Sequence.js and its API
- Multiple Test Theme - A theme to test multiple instances of Sequence

## Features

Sequence is packed full of features:

- Create animated themes using CSS transitions

1. Clear all [listed bugs](https://github.com/IanLunn/Sequence/issues?milestone=11&state=open)
- Implement reverse animations for the `reverseWhenNavigatingBackwards` option

## Browser Support

When Sequence reaches beta, we aim to support current versions of all major desktop browsers, and older versions of Internet Explorer 7 onwards.

[See the ever-growing browser support list](https://github.com/IanLunn/Sequence/wiki/Sequence-v2-Browser-Support)

## Premium Theme Partnership

When v2 launches, we will be looking for people who we can partner with to sell Sequence themes on the [official marketplace](http://sequencejs.com). If this is of interest, please [get in touch](http://sequencejs.com/contact/).

We will release further information about the premium theme partnership in the near future.
