Please read the following guidelines when submitting a bug or pull request.

## Submitting a Bug

Please note that the issue tracker is for bugs only -- either relating to sequence.js, its dependencies, or official Sequence themes. For support on your own Sequence themes, please use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=sequence|sequencejs) with the tags `sequence` and/or `sequencejs`.

### Before reporting a bug

1. Search [issue tracker](https://github.com/IanLunn/Sequence/issues) for similar issues.
2. Try the latest [dev branch](https://github.com/IanLunn/Sequence/tree/dev) version of sequence.js.

### How to report a bug

1. Specify the version number of the sequence.js library where the bug occurred (you'll find it toward the top of `sequence.js`, `sequence.min.js`, or `package.json`).
2. Specify your browser version and operating system (for example, Chrome 35, Windows 8)
3. Describe the problem in detail. Explain what happened, and what you expected would happen.
4. Provide a small test-case via [CodePen](http://codepen.io/), [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/), [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/), or similar. If a test-case is not possible, provide a link to a live version of your application.
5. If helpful, include a screenshot. Annotate the screenshot for clarity.
